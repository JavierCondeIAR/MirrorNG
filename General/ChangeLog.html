<p><strong>Mirror is published to the <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321">Asset Store</a> at the start of every month, unless some critical issue causes a delay.</strong></p>
<p>Mirror uses semantic versioning, and the versions shown here are those that were published to the Asset Store, and occasionally major version bumps happen mid-month between store submissions and are therefore not individually shown here.</p>
